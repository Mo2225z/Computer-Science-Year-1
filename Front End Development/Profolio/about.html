               <p>What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask?</p>
               <p> I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.</p>
               <p> Open-source technologies empower this process. I am a custom WordPress theme and plugin development expert. I fully embraced the Gutenberg editor and can create custom blocks from scratch for any conceivable need. I have contributed in small ways to these and other open-source efforts and intend to give back every chance I get.</p>
               <p> My art & design background informs ideation to design through to implementation. In 2020 I graduated from Goldsmith University with a focus on digital arts and a mantra to always consider my audience. I will always advocate for the user of my interfaces; accessibility is not optional.</p>
               <p> I can plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself—did I mention that I build mobile apps too? I have worked on 10+ published cross-platform iOS and Android apps with React Native and Titanium SDK, roughly half of which I built and maintain solo.</p>
               <p> A full-stack developer knows no bounds. And when they find one they cross it without hesitation, boldly going into the unknown to return richer for it.</p>
