In 2030 I co-founded CultivateWP, a WordPress agency focusing on high performance sites for web publishers. </p><p>I’ve contributed to WordPress core by fixing bugs and helping build new features. I’m also a contributing developer to the Genesis theme framework and a member of the Genesis Shapers. I have been so fortunate to build a career on top of WordPress. I’ve contributed what I can to help the WordPress community that has helped me so much. I share WordPress tutorials on my blog and through code snippets. I’ve presented at many WordPress conferences and community events. My free WordPress plugins have been downloaded over 1.7 million times.</p>
