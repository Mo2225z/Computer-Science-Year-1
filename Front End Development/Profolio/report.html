            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?</p>
            <p>My approach to the subject was to create 3 web pages using Html, CSS and JavaScript. I've used Grids, flex boxes, flex wrap and other methods for the layout of the website, and I've used JavaScript to change the layout of the website. I've linked CSS external style sheets all across all my HTML files as a way to reuse them for a more optimized design.</p>
            <p>The site details my future experience as a Web Developer. I've listed my key skills such as my profiency in mutiple software programs. For example I've given the amount of time I have been using different tools throughout the decade. I've listed my main skills on the about page and in the home page you will find a short background detailing my work experience </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Who is your audience?</p>
            <p>My audience is potential employers such as Facebook, Google and other tech companies. My website acts as a CV to help increase the chance of me being hired by a tech company as a web developer.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Portfolio 1 (and thoughts about it)</li>
               <p> https://caferati.me/ by  Rafael Caferati. The animations on this site are very striking and I took notice of the colour scheme on the website when developing my own website. I included a similar design when the user presses the light mode button on each website and most of the background changes to a grey colour while the text turns black.</p>
               <li>Portfolio 2 (and thoughts about it)</li>
               <p> https://benadam.me/thoughts/ by Ben Adam. The website's particularly general design is pretty clean and contemporary, and it really is consistent across all pages in a very major way. The site is very responsive as you resize the window and I took notice of this when designing my own website I created grid layouts for both mobile and computer screens.</p>
               <li>Portfolio 3 (and thoughts about it)</li>
               <p> https://sebkay.com/work by Seb kay. The website is straight to the point. It maintains a consistency within its design and is easily accessible. The simple layout for each page inspired me when creating my own website as everything flows together nicely. I keept the design consistent throghout my own website by using the same colour scheme throughout all 3 pages.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>
            <p> I used several youtube videos to plan for the layout of the website such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o and <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA <br> https://www.jimdo.com/website/portfolio/</p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Accessibility aspect 1</li>
               <p>All the images on my website have an alt tag which ensures those with visual impairments will not be put at a disadvantage. </p>
               <li>Accessibility aspect 2</li>
               <p>I've put an lang attribute on each page which is used to identify the language of text content on the web pages. Screen readers use this to switch language profiles to provide the correct accent and pronunciation.</p>
               <li>Accessibility aspect 3</li>
               <p> I've set the font sizes to appropriate sizes and I've used consistent semantic tags throughout the 3 web pages for screen readers to be able to better read the site. </p>
            </ul>
            <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
            <p> The navigation bar appears at the same place no matter the webpage and I've set it so once you hover over the links in the navigation bar the colour changes to red using CSS. This works really well because it highlights important links that can be clicked on for users</p>

         <section>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>There are multiple things I had to research. I had to study how to make grid template layouts and how to resize the templates based on mobile, tablet and computer screens. This required learning more about media queries in order to change the layout of the page based on the users device. I had to learn about flex boxes in order to create the navigation bar for each page. These required watching extensive you-tube videos from a playlist by Web Dev simplified. </p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <section>
               <h3>What worked well</h3>
               <p> The Grid Layouts for each website resize based on the user devices</p>
               <p>The button used to switch the colour scheme of the website when clicked works really well</p>
               <p> The Javascript I had written to change the middle image on the contact page when clicked works really well</p>
               <ul>
               </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h3>What might be improved</h3>
               <p>I could add better animations using Javascript instead of CSS to the website</p>
               <p> I need to improve my understanding of DOM manipulation using Javascript as I think what I've done using Javascript is very basic compared to what I might be able to do in the future. </p>
               <p>In the future I could try experimenting with Bootstrap to see if I can make a much better website using external JavaScript/CSS files</p>
               <ul>
